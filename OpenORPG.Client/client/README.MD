About the client
=================


The client is based off many technologies and written in JavaScript. It connects with the WebSocket based server and thus requires a web server and HTML5 based browser to run correctly. The build uses Grunt to compile, so be sure to use Node.js. If you're just a developer not looking to code, you might consider a prebuilt binary.

Technology
===========


*	GruntJS is used to build.
*	Phaser is used as a game engine to power the whole game, it makes developing fast and easy
*	The network backbone is homemade but can eventually be replaced by something more widespread





NOTES TO IMPROVE PHASER
=======================

*	It would be nice if Phaser was more defensive
	*	Would be helpful if it would let me know debug does not work in AUTO mode
