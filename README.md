open-orpg
=========

open-RPG is an online roleplaying game framework that runs on the web. It uses open-source tools to help developers create their own net dream on the internet and share with other players with little to no hassle. open-orpg takes a scalable and modern approach to online game engines.

Client
======

* Using a modern component system, open-orpg utilizes a modular and easy to use system that allows cutomization of entities with ease
* A web based client means your players will be accessible: Facebook, the web, a desktop client, mobile. If you build it, you can reach them.
* Built entirely in JavaScript and based on the ever grrowing Phaser, the client has access to amazing tools developed by something of the best growing opensource projects.
* Updates are instant -- using the HTTP protocol you don't need to worry about it.


Server
======

* A fully unit tested server to reduce bugs, it's one of the first open game sources that makes an effort to put speed and lack of bugs first
* With full load balancing, you don't need to worry about the software ever being the bottleneck to your dream. Scale horizontally - it's just that easy.
* Speed. We've built this server to be fast and modular. We want everyone to be able to develop on the lowest possible specifications we can. With growing technology, this has become possible even on a modern language such as C#
